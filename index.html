		<h4>I am a 2nd year PhD student at the <a href="https://www.wisc.edu/" target="_blank">University of Wisconsin-Madison</a>. I am advised by <a href="https://www.nicolasgarciat.com/" target="_blank">Nicolas Gracia Trillos</a> and <a href="http://www.jelena-diakonikolas.com/" target="_blank">Jelena Diakonikolas</a>. In Fall 2021, I am working as research Assistant supervised by <a href="https://jessicisewskikehe.github.io/" target="_blank">Jessi Cisewski Kehe</a>. Before that, I obtained my bachelor's degree in Math from <a href="http://www.math.zju.edu.cn/mathen/" target="_blank">Zhejiang University</a> in 2019. My thesis is about a Minsum packing optimization problem, supervised by Professor <a href=https://person.zju.edu.cn/en/0003325 target="_blank">Zhiyi Tan</a>. I obtained my master's degree in Statistics from <a href="https://www.wisc.edu/" target="_blank">University of Wisconsin-Madison</a> in 2020.

		Broadly speaking, I am interested in Machine Learning, Learning theory, topological data analysis and Optimization. 
		<br><br>
One line of my research lies in the intersection of optimization, adversarial learning and persistent homology, and study the change of topology phenomenon in these problems. I am trying to combine the topological structures among statistical learning, optimization and topological data analysis. In my research there is a way to use PDEs master the solution of the adversarial optimization problem, while it might face divergence some time. In TDA, topological change is the basis of the method, and it will identify significance. Inside optimization, there might be a decay of solution which also satisfying the topological changes effect, which is particularly important in finding a sparse solution.
    <br><br>
  The other line of my research involves calculus of variation and PDEs. Combining of statistical and applied mathematical are used to deal with the manifold clustering problem. My research mainly focuses on when there are multiple intersecting manifolds in Euclidean space, how we should do to identify them. I developed a general method to identify if an algorithm can work for this problem by using generalized multi-dimensional Laplacian operator in asymptotic way. From mathematics view of point, this line is based on continuum limit of random geometric graph.

		My research interests include graph, machine learning and convex optimization. Currently, I am working on a general framework for manifold clustering with <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Pengfei_He14" target="_blank">Pengfei He</a> and Professor <a href="https://www.nicolasgarciat.com/" target="_blank">Nicolas Gracia Trillos</a>. Also, I am exploring a minimax problem with Professor <a href="http://www.jelena-diakonikolas.com/" target="_blank">Jelena Diakonikolas</a>. In Spring 2021, I will work as Research Assistant supervised by Professor <a href="https://jessicisewskikehe.github.io/" target="_blank">Jessi Cisewski Kehe</a>.
