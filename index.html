		<h4>I am a 2nd year PhD student at <a href="https://www.wisc.edu/" target="_blank">University of Wisconsin-Madison</a>. I am advised by <a href="https://www.nicolasgarciat.com/" target="_blank">Nicolas Gracia Trillos</a> and <a href="http://www.jelena-diakonikolas.com/" target="_blank">Jelena Diakonikolas</a>. Before that, I obtained my bachelor's degree in Math from <a href="http://www.math.zju.edu.cn/mathen/" target="_blank">Zhejiang University</a> in 2019. My thesis is about a Minsum packing optimization problem supervised by Professor <a href=https://person.zju.edu.cn/en/0003325 target="_blank">Zhiyi Tan</a>. I got my master's degree in Statistics from <a href="https://www.wisc.edu/" target="_blank">University of Wisconsin-Madison</a> in 2020.
		<br><br>
  Broadly speaking, my interests span Machine Learning, Learning theory, topological data analysis, and Optimization, and my background is a mix of Maths, Statistics, and computer sciences.
		<br><br>
		One of my ongoing research lines involves the calculus of variation and PDEs when dealing with the spectral manifold clustering problem. The philosophy is to find the continuum analog that can work as an ideal population-level counterpart in a geometric or calculation setting. In particular, one of my research focuses on identifying points from multiple intersecting manifolds. Specifically, the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of graph Laplacian can be guaranteed to approximate the corresponding ones of the generalized high-dimensional Laplacian Beltrami operator theoretically. As a result, the eigenvectors of graph Laplacian in the null space will be close to the indicator function on different manifolds, guaranteeing recovery of clustering. From a mathematical view of point, this line is based on the continuum limit of a random geometric graph, and path algorithms can be designed based on
		<br><br>
		geometric intuition, with the potential to solve a non-spectral problem.
Another line of my research lies in an intersection between Optimization and traditional Statistics. I am interested in exploring a gap perspective optimization method on some statistical problems. Precisely, I am interested in designing a width(such as spectral values) independent algorithm for the convex optimization problem. For example, one of my works is finding a coordinate-wise update method to solve Non-Negative Least Squares problems. The Primal-Dual algorithm can find a solution without involving any width parameter in the algorithm complexity.
<br><br>
I am also interested in learning a connection between adversarial learning and regularization. For example, we captured a series of adversarial problems connecting the Strongly contamination model and $l_2$ contamination model. In my research, we can use a PDEs method to track the solution of the adversarial optimization problem, which can capture an entire ensemble of problems. However, the problem might face divergence some time. I am also interested in developing a topological description of the collapse of PDEs.

The other line of my research lies in an intersection among optimization, adversarial learning, and persistent homology, studying a change of topology phenomenon in these problems. We can use PDEs to track the solution of the adversarial optimization problem, solving an entire ensemble of problems. However, this change of parameters might lead to divergence some time, suggesting a topological change. In TDA, topological change is the basis of the method, and the collapse of features will identify significance. Further, a decay of topology appears widely in the optimization problem. For example, sparsity of solution will usually mean a change of topology. Therefore, it is essential to develop a combined description and commonness of the topological structures among these studies.

		
		My research interests include graph, machine learning and convex optimization. Currently, I am working on a general framework for manifold clustering with <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Pengfei_He14" target="_blank">Pengfei He</a> and Professor <a href="https://www.nicolasgarciat.com/" target="_blank">Nicolas Gracia Trillos</a>. Also, I am exploring a minimax problem with Professor <a href="http://www.jelena-diakonikolas.com/" target="_blank">Jelena Diakonikolas</a>. In Spring 2021, I will work as Research Assistant supervised by Professor <a href="https://jessicisewskikehe.github.io/" target="_blank">Jessi Cisewski Kehe</a>.
