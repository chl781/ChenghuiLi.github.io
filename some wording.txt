The other line of my research lies in an intersection among optimization, adversarial learning, and persistent homology, studying a change of topology phenomenon in these problems. We can use PDEs to track the solution of the adversarial optimization problem, solving an entire ensemble of problems. However, this change of parameters might lead to divergence some time, suggesting a topological change. In TDA, topological change is the basis of the method, and the collapse of features will identify significance. Further, a decay of topology appears widely in the optimization problem. For example, sparsity of solution will usually mean a change of topology. Therefore, it is essential to develop a combined description and commonness of the topological structures among these studies.
